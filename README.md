Fractals on html canvas
=======================
Simple simulations of [Diffusion-limited aggregation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion-limited_aggregation)
fractals. 

There are a couple of different variations of the same simulation. To run the
simulation, just open the index.html file in a browser. The program is only
tested in Chrome and Firefox so to get the best results, use one of these.

Why
---
Inspired by a C++ program created by a friend of mine who studies for a PhD in
physics, Fractals on html canvas is an experiment in creating the same fractals
using JavaScript and the html canvas element.
