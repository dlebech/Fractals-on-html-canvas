Inspired by a C++ program created by a friend of mine who studies for a PhD in
physics, Fractals on html canvas is an experiment in creating the same fractals
using JavaScript and the html canvas element.

To run the simulation, just open the index.html file in a browser. The program
is only tested in Chrome and Firefox so for best results, use one of these.
